# Assignment 5: Loop Design Challenges

## Challenge 1: Collatz Conjecture
- **Loop Type**: `while` loop
- **Reason**: The number of iterations is unknown; we loop until `n == 1`.
- **Logic**: Apply even/odd rule, print each step, count iterations.

## Challenge 2: Prime Number Checker
- **Loop Type**: `for` loop
- **Reason**: We know the range (2 to n-1); ideal for fixed iteration.
- **Logic**: Check divisibility, break early if a divisor is found.

## Challenge 3: Multiplication Table Grid
- **Loop Type**: Nested `for` loops
- **Reason**: Outer loop for rows, inner for columns â€” perfect for 2D structure.
- **Logic**: Print header, then each row with aligned products.
